# Automatic application opening with a Window terminal
With this program, you can open automatically a program like Google Chrome from your Window terminal whenever you want.
## How it works
When the batchfile [test_copie.bat](https://github.com/AliochaFilipovitch/Automatic-program-opening/blob/master/test_copie.bat) runs, the loop check every 60 seconds the time of your computeur with your condition about the time in _if_. When the condition is ok, [test.bat](https://github.com/AliochaFilipovitch/Automatic-program-opening/blob/master/test.bat) runs, opens Google Chrome during 20 seconds, closes it and the loop keeps.
